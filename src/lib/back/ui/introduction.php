First time here ? Welcome then ! Let me explain why you might be here :

You might be a curious person:

- Some random guy told you he did a website and you took a look. Well, thanks !
- You like shady, underground, extremely new or extremely unknown music. That's rad.
- Statistics is your hobby. I don't judge.

Or maybe are-you a music enthusiast :

- You extensively use iTunes and have a good looking library.
- You are a Metadata nazi, probably using MusicBrainz Picard to keep things in order.
- You like to share your beautiful music tastes to people you meet.

BINGO, <?= $appName ?> is for you. 

Get started by creating an account, or simply navigate through our users accounts to discover new exciting music.
Use the companion app to upload your library and stream in real time what you are playing on iTunes ! Cool, isn't it ? 

If you would like to thank me for the awesome work, have a question, or anything really, don't hesitate to contact me at haveakitkat@hotmail.fr.
Oh, and you might also find bugs here and there by the way, it's still in beta.
